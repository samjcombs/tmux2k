<p>Fork of <a href="https://2kabhishek.github.io/tmux2k">tmux2k</a> to fix the weather widget, making it more zen and overcoming the fact that the fixed location doesnt really work.  Also relies only on icon for weather status rather than the word, saving valuable space.   Icon + temp, thats it.  tmux2k is badass, you should try it...</p>
