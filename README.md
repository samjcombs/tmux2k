## tmux2k w/ working zen weather widget
<p>Fork of <a href="https://2kabhishek.github.io/tmux2k">tmux2k</a> to fix the weather widget, making it more zen and overcoming the fact that the fixed location doesnt really work.</p>
<p>Also relies only on icon for weather status rather than the word, saving valuable space.   Icon + temp, thats it.  tmux2k is badass, you should try it...</p>

## Check out that widget
